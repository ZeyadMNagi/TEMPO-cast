        <h1>WHO Instructions for Air pollution</h1>
        <h1>How to Protect Yourself from Air Pollution — Verified Guidance</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Short, verified guidance on how to check air
          quality and reduce your exposure to harmful air pollution (daily
          pollution, wildfire smoke, and short-term pollution spikes).
          Recommendations below are from the
          <a
            href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health"
            target="_blank"
            >World Health Organization (WHO)</a
          >
          and national public-health agencies (EPA, Health Canada, UKHSA / UK
          Government).
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Air pollution increases the risk of heart and lung disease and worsens
          asthma, COPD, and other health conditions. Nearly all people globally
          breathe air exceeding recommended guideline limits. Reducing exposure
          during high pollution improves health immediately and over the long
          term.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Check Air Quality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Official AQI / index services:</strong> In the U.S., use
            <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/" target="_blank">AirNow (EPA)</a>
            AQI. Many countries provide an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) or
            local AQI. These indices translate pollutant concentrations into
            easy color-coded health messages. Check before outdoor plans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile apps & notifications:</strong> Use national apps
            (e.g.,
            <a
              href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index-app.html"
              target="_blank"
              >WeatherCAN</a
            >) or widely used apps displaying local AQI and alerts. Many public
            agencies allow custom alerts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Understand the index categories:</strong> AQI categories
            (Good / Moderate / Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups / Unhealthy / Very
            Unhealthy / Hazardous) indicate when to change behavior (avoid
            outdoor exertion, close windows, etc.).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basic Protective Measures</h2>

        <h3>A. Reduce Outdoor Exposure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Limit outdoor exercise and heavy exertion when AQI is “Unhealthy for
            Sensitive Groups” or worse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reschedule outdoor events to times with lower AQI (often morning or
            after rain).
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow official “stay indoors” or “shelter” warnings from local
            authorities.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Improve Indoor Air Quality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep outdoor pollution out: close windows/doors during high
            pollution (wildfire smoke, dust storms).
          </li>
          <li>
            Use mechanical filtration: HEPA air cleaners are most effective; if
            unavailable, a box fan + MERV-rated filter works as a DIY
            alternative.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid indoor pollution sources: stop burning candles, wood, incense;
            avoid frying foods at high heat; no indoor smoking.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Personal Protective Equipment (Masks)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            N95 / FFP2 / KN95 respirators reduce inhaled particles if fitted
            properly. Recommended during high-pollution events or for vulnerable
            people who must go outside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Surgical masks and cloth masks are less effective against fine
            PM2.5.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Special Guidance for Vulnerable People</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Children, older adults, pregnant people, and those with heart/lung
            disease or diabetes should avoid outdoor exertion at AQI > 100.
          </li>
          <li>Keep medications handy and follow clinician’s emergency plan.</li>
          <li>
            Consider temporary relocation to areas of lower pollution if
            prolonged high pollution is expected.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wildfires — Specific Actionable Steps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay indoors with windows closed and run a HEPA air cleaner.</li>
          <li>
            Avoid physical exertion outdoors — even healthy adults should reduce
            strenuous activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use N95/FFP2 respirators if going outside; surgical/cloth masks are
            much less protective.
          </li>
          <li>Follow local evacuation and public-safety orders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Quick Guide</h2>
        <div class="quick-guide">
          <strong>AQI ≤ 50 (Good):</strong> Normal activities.<br />
          <strong>AQI 51–100 (Moderate):</strong> Sensitive people — consider
          reducing prolonged outdoor exertion.<br />
          <strong>AQI 101–150 (Unhealthy for sensitive groups):</strong>
          Children, elderly, respiratory/cardiac conditions — avoid prolonged
          outdoor exertion; consider indoor air cleaning.<br />
          <strong>AQI > 150 (Unhealthy / Very Unhealthy / Hazardous):</strong>
          Everyone should reduce outdoor activities; vulnerable people stay
          indoors with filtered air or respirators; follow local health
          advisories.
        </div>

        <h2>Communications & Public-Health Integration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Set alerts in your app for AQI thresholds — Health Canada and other
            agencies support custom notifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use clear plain-language messages (color + short action) instead of
            raw pollutant numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cite sources in your app’s Tips/Resources page (WHO, EPA, Health
            Canada, UKHSA) for authority.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Short Copy (Ready to Paste)</h2>
        <p>
          Protect yourself from air pollution — Check local air quality before
          going outside. If the Air Quality Index (AQI) is in the “Unhealthy”
          range, reduce outdoor activity, close windows, and use a HEPA air
          cleaner indoors if possible. Vulnerable groups (children, elderly,
          people with heart or lung disease) should take extra precautions or
          avoid outdoor exposure. For smoke events, wear a certified N95/FFP2
          respirator if you must go outside. (<a
