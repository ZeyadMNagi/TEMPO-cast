**Global TEMPO** is a public health application that makes life-saving air quality data accessible to everyone. It integrates real-time satellite data from **NASA's TEMPO mission** with global ground sensors and weather forecasts to provide a complete, localized picture of the air we breathe.

The platform not only visualizes complex pollution data on an interactive map but also sends **personalized health alerts** to vulnerable users based on their specific health profiles. By combining satellite technology, a custom-built local sensor network, and a user-centric design, Global TEMPO empowers communities to understand their environment and take action to protect their health.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Application

- **üìä Real-Time AQI & Weather**: Get up-to-the-minute Air Quality Index (AQI) based on US EPA standards, integrated with current weather context.
- **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Global Map**: A Leaflet-based map to visualize air quality for any location worldwide.
- **üìà Forecasts & Historical Trends**: View hourly air quality forecasts and analyze historical data trends to understand pollution patterns.
- **üåê Multi-Language Support**: Fully internationalized interface supporting both English and Arabic (RTL).
- **üîç Advanced Search**: Find locations by city name, coordinates, or by using your device's current location.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Data Integration

- **NASA TEMPO Viewer**: A dedicated map interface to visualize near real-time NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and Formaldehyde data layers directly from the NASA TEMPO satellite over North America.
- **GEMS Satellite Data**: Integrates data from South Korea's GEMS satellite, providing similar air quality insights over Asia.
- **On-Demand Loading**: GEMS satellite imagery is fetched and cached on-demand by the server to ensure performance and data freshness.

### üîî Personalized Notification System

- **Health-Profile Based Alerts**: Users can subscribe to notifications and create a detailed health profile (age, respiratory conditions like asthma, pregnancy, etc.).
- **Customizable Triggers**: Set personal AQI thresholds and notification frequency (real-time, daily, etc.) to receive alerts that matter to you.
- **Intelligent Backend**: A cron job runs hourly, checking air quality for each subscriber's location and sending beautifully formatted HTML email alerts with personalized health advice when thresholds are met.
- **Full Subscription Management**: Users can subscribe, manage preferences, and unsubscribe through secure, unique links.

### üî¨ Community Science & Hardware

- **Arduino Prototype**: A custom-built, Arduino-based hardware sensor for hyper-local environmental monitoring (Temperature, Humidity, Light, Rain, Water Temperature).
- **Open Hardware**: A dedicated page showcases the hardware design and data transmission workflow, encouraging community participation and data contribution.
